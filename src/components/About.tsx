						<h2>WHO we are:</h2>
						Gamp Camp, Inc. is a 501(c)3 non-profit organization (EIN:
						92-1117062) with a mission to provide assisted privacy for patients
						accessing reproductive health care. Led by a Board of Directors,
						volunteers are organized weekly to provide services of support and
						privacy to patients, as well as friends and family members of
						patients, throughout their visit to the doctor.
					</li>
					<li>
						<h2>WHAT we do:</h2>
						We encounter protestors on a daily basis that attempt to deter and
						harass patients. With the help of rainbow “gamps” a.k.a. umbrellas,
						our volunteer clinic escorts shield patients from the protestors and
						help them gain safe passage to the clinic. We also provide a safe,
						welcoming space for patients and their support people as they wait.
